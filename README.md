# Telecommunication-Final-Year-Project
Telecommunication Churn Price Prediction Project. 


# Summary:

Customer retention is the ability of a company or a product to retain its existing customers. This notebook proposes some propensity model that predicts the likelihood of a customer to curn from a network provider. This solution does not only entail "who" - It also entails "when".

Churn is a one of the biggest problem in the telecom industry, and this is because customers are free to choose from a variety of network providers within a product category. Retaining existing customers is believed to be more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Therefore, Keeping churn rates as low as possible is what every business pursuits, and understanding these metrics can assist companies to identify potential churners in time to prevent them from leaving the client base.

The proposed models will allow the network provider to allocate the resources more wisely, resulting in greater efficiencies while achieving better results.
